# 🖥 Markdown Course LIVE on Scrimba

Markdown allows us to write HTML in a quick and fluid way. We use this on the regular for our code reviews, comment sections and README files again and again. 

At first glance the importance of **Markdown** may not seem all that important. You would be ~~right~~ wrong! Readability in your PRs and being able to communicate your point clearly and cleanly is crucial. Its not _uncommon_ for engineers to create documents ahead of time to their team members for future features on apps that support Markdown to get their point across!
