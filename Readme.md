Python was created in the late 1980s by **Guido van Rossum**. The first version of Python was released in 1991. Since then, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

>"Python is a great first language, and a great last language." - Guido van Rossum

Python is a simple language to learn. The syntax is easy to understand, and there are many resources available to help beginners get started. Once you have learned the basics, you can start to build your own projects.

Python is also a powerful language. It can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including web development, data science, and machine learning. It is also used by many large companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Netflix.

#### Here is a table of Python versions and their release years:

| Version | Year |
|---|---|
| Python 1.0 | 1991 |
| Python 2.0 | 2000 |
| Python 3.0 | 2008 |
| Python 3.1 | 2009 |
| Python 3.2 | 2010 |
| Python 3.3 | 2012 |
| Python 3.4 | 2014 |
| Python 3.5 | 2015 |
| Python 3.6 | 2016 |
| Python 3.7 | 2018 |
| Python 3.8 | 2019 |
| Python 3.9 | 2020 |
| Python 3.10 | 2021 |

#### Here is a sample Python code

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(5))
```

This code defines a function called `factorial()` that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120.

The code first checks if the number is 0. If it is, then the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself, passing in the number minus 1. The recursive call will eventually reach the base case, where the number is 0, and the function will return 1.

The code then prints the result of the `factorial()` function. In this case, the result is 120.

#### Summary

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is easy to learn. It is a great choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. If you are looking for a programming language to learn, I highly recommend Python.
